Tasks To Complete:
0. Basic Annotations - Add
In 0-add.py, you'll find a type-annotated function named add. It takes two float arguments, a and b, and returns their sum as a float.

1. Basic Annotations - Concat
Inside 1-concat.py, there's a type-annotated function called concat. It takes two string arguments, str1 and str2, and returns their concatenated string.

2. Basic Annotations - Floor
In 2-floor.py, you'll see a type-annotated function named floor. It accepts a float argument, n, and returns the floor of the float.

3. Basic Annotations - To String
Within 3-to_str.py, there's a type-annotated function called to_str. It takes a float argument, n, and returns the string representation of the float.

4. Define Variables
In 4-define_variables.py, you'll define and annotate the following variables:
- a: an integer with a value of 1
- pi: a float with a value of 3.14
- i_understand_annotations: a boolean with a value of True
- school: a string with a value of "Holberton"

5. Complex Types - List of Floats
Inside 5-sum_list.py, there's a type-annotated function named sum_list. It takes a list of floats, input_list, as an argument and returns their sum as a float.

6. Complex Types - Mixed List
In 6-sum_mixed_list.py, you'll find a type-annotated function named sum_mixed_list. It takes a list, mxd_lst, containing integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

7. Complex Types - String and Int/Float to Tuple
Within 7-to_kv.py, there's a type-annotated function named to_kv. It takes a string, k, and an int or float, v, as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v, annotated as a float.

8. Complex Types - Functions
In 8-make_multiplier.py, there's a type-annotated function named make_multiplier. It takes a float, multiplier, as an argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by the multiplier.

9. Let's Duck Type an Iterable Object
Inside 9-element_length.py, you'll annotate the function's parameters and return values with appropriate types. The function, element_length(lst), returns a list of tuples containing elements from lst and their corresponding lengths.

10. Duck Typing - First Element of a Sequence
In 100-safe_first_element.py, you'll augment a function with correct duck-typed annotations. The function safe_first_element(lst) retrieves the first element of a sequence if it exists.

11. More Involved Type Annotations
Within 101-safely_get_value.py, you'll include code with type annotations. The function safely_get_value(dct, key, default = None) retrieves a value from a dictionary using a given key.

12. Type Checking
In 102-type_checking.py, you'll use mypy to validate the code and apply any necessary changes. The function zoom_array(lst: Tuple, factor: int = 2) -> Tuple creates multiple copies of items in a tuple, with the factor specifying the number of copies.
